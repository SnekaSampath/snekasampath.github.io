                            At the core of my leadership philosophy is empathy, and I'm unwaveringly passionate about empowering my team to craft extraordinary user experiences.

                        <h2 class="about__subtitle">My story</h2>
                        <p class="parafontabout">From young age, I've had an innate affinity for Computer Science and programming. 
                            Pursuing both my Bachelor's and Postgraduate degrees in Information Technology exposed me to a wide range of experiences within the industry.
                            <br><br>
                            My career started as a developer working on backend applications for insurance industry. 
                            However, my journey took an unexpected turn when I was invited to assist with a mobile app project as a design consultant. 
                            This opportunity ignited my passion for design and set me on the path to becoming a UX Designer, even before I formally studied UX.
                            <br><br>
                            As the sole designer in my workplace, I embraced a steep learning curve, continuously refining my skills through both achievements and setbacks. 
                            Eventually, I decided to further enhance my expertise in UX Design by pursuing advanced education at the University of Toronto. 
                            This academic journey allowed me to deepen my knowledge and solidify my career in this exciting field.
                            
                             </p>
                            <br>
                            <h2 class="about__subtitle">What sets me apart</h2>
                           <p class="parafontabout"> 
                            In my early days as a developer, I became skilled at designing within technical constraints. 
                            My background in behavioral economics helped me create designs that fit well with how users behave. 
                            I'm a strong advocate for making design decisions based on data, and I regularly test designs with users to ensure they work effectively.
                            I've also worked closely with experts to set up analytics systems for ongoing feedback after we launch products. 
                            This helps us continually improve user experiences while making sure we meet our business goals.
                            <br><br>        
                            As a design leader, I aim to integrate these experiences I've gained to empower my team to 
                            go beyond their traditional roles as UX Designers or Writers. 
                            I want them to become UX Strategists who collaborate with the business leaders to create user-friendly experiences that drive our organization's success.
                            </p>

                      <!-- <p class="parafontabout"> When I am not spending my time designing, I love illustrating, travelling and exploring new places, whether it's a day in the beach or a hike up the mountain. <a  href="https://instagram.com/snekawanders_draws?utm_medium=copy_link" target="_blank"> Check out my illustrations. </a></p> -->
                       
                       <p class="parafontabout">I'm always eager to connect with fellow professionals, potential collaborators, and organizations seeking a UX Design leader capable of driving innovation and delivering outstanding results.
